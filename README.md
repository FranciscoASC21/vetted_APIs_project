# vetted_APIs_project

## Specifications

- You’ll be tasked with creating a website that uses at least 2 APIs to gather and display information to the user. The purpose of the website is to do something that is completely useless!
    - For example: my website asks the user for a number as input. When the user submits the number, the website displays an eatery that is associated with that number (Cornell Dining API), replaces all of the letter “a” with “WOOF” and adds a dog image (Dog Image API).

## Intructions

1. Take ~5 minutes to explore the following APIs.
    - https://pokeapi.co/
    - https://www.boredapi.com/
    - https://agify.io/
    - https://funtranslations.com/api/#yoda
        - This API limits to 5 requests per hour
    - https://dog.ceo/dog-api/
    - https://docs.thecatapi.com/
    - https://catfact.ninja/
    - https://kitsu.docs.apiary.io/#introduction/json:api
    - https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/
    - Many more!

2. Brainstorm the concept for your website and present your idea to your instructors, making sure to outline:
    - Which API’s you’re using and how they’ll work together
    - What each person is doing

3. Once approved, make your wireframes:
    - Submit your wireframes to be approved

4. You may begin creating!
    - *Note: Be kind to the API server(s)! Don’t spam refresh your browser or loop 100 individual requests - this can get your IP address blacklisted!*

## Extra Credit

- Make your site responsive
    - Make sure it looks good on tablet, and mobile
